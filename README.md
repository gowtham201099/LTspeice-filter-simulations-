# 🎛️ Analog Filter Simulations – LTspice

This repository contains simulation results and circuit designs for various analog filters created as part of my analog electronics learning journey.

## 📂 Contents

- **RL Filters**
  - Basic low-pass and high-pass configurations
- **RLC Filters**
  - Band-pass and band-stop (notch) filter designs

All circuits were built and simulated using **LTspice**.

## 🔧 Tools Used

- 💻 LTspice (Analog circuit simulation)
- 🧠 Curiosity, textbooks, and trial-and-error

## 🖼️ Sample Results

You can find screenshots of LTspice simulations for each filter design in the `images/` folder.
